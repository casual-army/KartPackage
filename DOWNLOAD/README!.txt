I know making this is extremely pointless, but since I'm getting tired of people that don't know how to enter the server, here are some steps:

1. Download all the files by zip (duh)

2. Open the zip file and drag or extract "Foximilian's Addons" folder to the root of your SRB2Kart folder
 -If you have the "DOWNLOADS" folder, do NOT extract Foximilian's Addons to that folder! You will not enter whatsoever! just drag it inside your SRB2Kart folder!

3. After completing step 2, launch the game and do NOT load up the files. Just join and the server will load up all of the addons.

4. If you can't find the server, the IP is 172.91.43.41:5029 (although you can find it at hyuu.cc)

5. Go fast and eat ass.
